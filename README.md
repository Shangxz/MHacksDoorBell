# Decibell

An innovative smart Facial recognition door bell that will scan for people that come up to your front porch. It is an alexa integrated doorbell where alexa will narrate the name of the person standing in front of your door, pulling out the data from the user's social profiles as well as through one time user registration and running machine learning and AI apis of Amazon AWS and AZure to train the data.  

Furthermore it can act as a first line of defence, as alexa can narrate whether it is safe to open door and the activities happening outside our door.
